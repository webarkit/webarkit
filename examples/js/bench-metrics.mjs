 * quality or tracking fields. What the tracker reports is copied as it
 * reports it; nothing is recomputed. `stageTimings` is the page's per-stage
 * timings object (copied: the page reuses one every tick), and `targetPoints`
 * the target's corners from {@link targetCorners}.
 *
 * `mediaTimeSeconds` is the frame's position in the clip — compare two
 * exports by it, never by index: frames the main thread was too busy for are
 * skipped, and two modes skip different ones (examples/README.md).
 * `numSceneKeypoints` is what `detect` returned: at most the run's
 * `maxKeypoints`, fewer on a frame with fewer corners — `match` is a
 * brute-force search over these, so a `match` timing means nothing without
 * it — and 0 on a TRACK frame, where nothing is detected.
